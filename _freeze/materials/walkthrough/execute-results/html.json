Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data to predict outcomes, unsupervised learning works with input data that does not have any corresponding output variables. The primary goal is to explore the underlying structure, groupings, or features in the data.\n\nOne of the most common applications of unsupervised learning is clustering, where the algorithm groups similar data points together based on their characteristics. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression. Another key technique is dimensionality reduction, which aims to reduce the number of variables under consideration, making it easier to visualize and interpret large datasets.\n\nUnsupervised learning is valuable because it can reveal insights that may not be immediately apparent, uncovering relationships and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. It is commonly used in exploratory data analysis and as a preprocessing step for other algorithms. As data continues to grow in complexity and volume, unsupervised learning plays a critical role in making sense of unstructured information.\n\n### Motivation\n\nHere is a picture I took of a pavement in Cambridge the day after Valentine's Day. Why did this picture capture my attention? The starkness of the grey pavement contrasted with the bright red rose. It may have triggered some unsupervised learning mechanism in my brain that allows me to pick anomalies!\n\n![Rose after Valentine's Day](images/rose_after_valentines_day.png)\n\nUnsupervised learning is all about discovering structure in data without any explicit “right answers” to guide you. Your rose‑on‑pavement photo is a perfect real‑world illustration of a few core ideas:\n\n* Anomaly (or Outlier) Detection\n- **What happened in your brain:**  \n  When you look at a uniform grey pavement, your visual system builds an internal “model” of what’s normal—flat, texture‑repeating, monochrome. The bright red rose doesn’t fit that model, so it “pops,” drawing your attention.\n\n- **In machine learning:**  \n  Algorithms like Isolation Forests, One‑Class SVMs, or autoencoder‑based detectors learn a representation of “normal” data (e.g. patches of pavement) and then flag anything that deviates significantly (e.g. the rose) as an anomaly.\n\n* Feature Extraction & Saliency\n- **Human vision analogy:**  \n  Early in the visual cortex, neurons respond to edges, color contrasts, textures. A red circle on grey evokes strong responses in “color” and “shape‑edge” channels.\n\n- **ML counterpart:**  \n  Techniques like PCA or deep autoencoders learn low‑dimensional “features” (color histograms, texture filters). Dimensions where the rose is extreme (high red‑channel value) are exactly the ones that give us the “anomaly” score.\n\n* Clustering & Pattern Discovery\nYou might not only notice the rose, but if there were lots of petals scattered around, your brain could start grouping (clustering) regions of similar color/shape.\n\nUnsupervised clustering algorithms (k‑means, DBSCAN) would partition image patches into clusters—“pavement patches,” “rose petals,” maybe even “shadows.” Anything that doesn’t belong to a big cluster may again be flagged as rare.\n\n* Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization\nIn a high‑dimensional feature space (e.g. each 10×10 pixel patch → a 300‑dim vector), you can’t “see” clusters easily. Algorithms like t‑SNE or UMAP compress that down to 2D so you can actually plot and see the rose‑patches separate from pavement.\n\nThis is why, for instance, visual analytics tools will show outliers as distant points on a scatterplot—just as you instantly spot the rose on the pavement.\n\n\n\n### Resources\n\n[PCA intuition](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues)\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Key Concept \n\n![Information bottleneck](images/information_bottleneck.png)\n\nIn unsupervised learning, the __bottleneck concept__ refers to a deliberate architectural constraint in a model—typically an autoencoder—where information is compressed through a narrow intermediate representation, often called a latent code or embedding. The model is trained to reconstruct the input data after passing it through this low-dimensional bottleneck, forcing it to learn a compact and informative representation of the underlying structure of the data. Since there are no labels guiding the learning process, the model relies solely on reconstructing its input as accurately as possible, using only the limited information passed through this narrow channel. This compression encourages the model to capture essential features while discarding noise or redundancy.\n\nThe bottleneck acts as an inductive bias that promotes dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and denoising. By minimizing reconstruction error while constrained by a reduced latent space, the model implicitly discovers patterns, clusters, and hierarchies within the input data. In practical terms, this is a foundational principle behind many unsupervised representation learning methods, including classical autoencoders, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and self-supervised learning systems that rely on contrastive or generative objectives. The learned low-dimensional codes can then be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization (e.g., with t-SNE or PCA), or as inputs to supervised models in a semi-supervised setting.\n\nmagine you have a huge library of biological images—say, pictures of different cell types under a microscope—and you want to teach a computer to recognize patterns in those images without telling it what any of the cells are. A “bottleneck” in this context is like asking the computer to summarize each image using only a few key words instead of the entire picture. By forcing it to compress all the rich detail down to a small summary, the computer has to figure out which features—like cell shape, size, or texture—are truly important. This is similar to how a biologist might sketch a simplified diagram of a cell, highlighting its nucleus and membrane but leaving out every ribosome and microtubule.\n\nBecause the computer must recreate the original image from that stripped‑down summary, it learns to ignore random noise or unimportant quirks (like slight variations in lighting) and focus on the core characteristics shared by similar cell types. In other words, the bottleneck helps the machine discover the hidden “essence” of the data. Once you have those concise summaries, you can use them to cluster cells into groups, visualize how different cell types relate, or even feed them into a second analysis—just as you might reduce a complex DNA dataset to a handful of genetic markers before drawing a phylogenetic tree. This approach lets you explore and interpret large biological datasets more effectively, all without ever providing explicit labels.\n:::\n\n\n### Example\n\nGiven the data below, how should we reduce the number of features and/or visualize it? This is an **unsupervised** machine learning problem.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n**NOTE (IMPORTANT CONCEPT)**: The columns of this data are the *features*.\n:::\n\n\n| State       | Murder (per 100k) | Robbery (per 100k) | Population     |\n|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| California  | 9.1               | 45.3               | 39,512,223     |\n| Texas       | 7.8               | 38.6               | 28,995,881     |\n| Florida     | 5.9               | 31.7               | 21,477,737     |\n| New York    | 3.4               | 26.4               | 19,453,561     |\n| Illinois    | 6.4               | 35.1               | 12,671,821     |\n| Pennsylvania| 4.8               | 22.9               | 12,801,989     |\n\n\nImportantly, we are not trying to predict anything.
