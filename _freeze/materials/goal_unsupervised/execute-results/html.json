These hypotheses can be tested by collecting more data.\n\n\n## Thought exercise\n\n* Can you think of a technique where unsupervised learning gets used a lot? _Hint_: we use it almost every day now! (or atleast I do)\n\n::: {.callout-hint collapse=”true”}\n\nChatGPT or Generative AI. The first step in processing the huge amount of text is to *reduce* the dimensions of the data using something similar to PCA.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key Points\n\n- The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns and form hypotheses.\n\n:::\n\n",
