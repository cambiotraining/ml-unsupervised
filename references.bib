   abstract = {Objective Dysregulated immune responses are the cause of IBDs. Studies in mice and humans suggest a central role of interleukin (IL)-23-producing mononuclear phagocytes in disease pathogenesis. Mechanistic insights into the regulation of IL-23 are prerequisite for selective IL-23 targeting therapies as part of personalised medicine. Design We performed transcriptomic analysis to investigate IL-23 expression in human mononuclear phagocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We investigated the regulation of IL-23 expression and used single-cell RNA sequencing to derive a transcriptomic signature of hyperinflammatory monocytes. Using gene network correlation analysis, we deconvolved this signature into components associated with homeostasis and inflammation in patient biopsy samples. Results We characterised monocyte subsets of healthy individuals and patients with IBD that express IL-23. We identified autosensing and paracrine sensing of IL-1α/IL-1β and IL-10 as key cytokines that control IL-23-producing monocytes. Whereas Mendelian genetic defects in IL-10 receptor signalling induced IL-23 secretion after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, whole bacteria exposure induced IL-23 production in controls via acquired IL-10 signalling resistance. We found a transcriptional signature of IL-23-producing inflammatory monocytes that predicted both disease and resistance to antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and differentiated that from an IL-23-associated lymphocyte differentiation signature that was present in homeostasis and in disease. Conclusion Our work identifies IL-10 and IL-1 as critical regulators of monocyte IL-23 production. We differentiate homeostatic IL-23 production from hyperinflammation-associated IL-23 production in patients with severe ulcerating active Crohn’s disease and anti-TNF treatment non-responsiveness. Altogether, we identify subgroups of patients with IBD that might benefit from IL-23p19 and/or IL-1α/IL-1β-targeting therapies upstream of IL-23.},

abstract={The mosaic nature of hybrid genomes is well recognized, but little is known of how they are shaped initially by patterns of breeding, selection, recombination and differential incompatibilities. On the small Gal{\'a}pagos island of Daphne Major, two species of Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis and G. scandens, hybridize rarely and back-cross bidirectionally with little or no loss of fitness under conditions of plentiful food. We used whole-genome sequences to compare genomes from periods before and after successful interbreeding followed by back-crossing. We inferred extensive introgression from G. fortis to G. scandens on autosomes and mitochondria but not on the Z chromosome. The unique combination of long-term field observations and genomic data shows that the reduction of gene flow for Z-linked loci primarily reflects female-biased gene flow, arising from a hybrid-male disadvantage in competition for high-quality territories and mates, rather than from genetic incompatibilities at Z-linked loci.},
